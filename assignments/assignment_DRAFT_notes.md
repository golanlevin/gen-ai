### 2.1 From Can't to [Cant](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cant)

[*10 minutes*] For new learners, there is a ton of unfamiliar terminology in AI and Machine Learning. Below is a list of online glossaries. Browse through these until you see a term you recognize but don't understand:

* [Machine Learning Glossary](https://www.deepchecks.com/glossary/) (Deepchecks)
* [Machine Learning Glossary](https://machinelearning.wtf/) (machinelearning.wtf)
* [Machine Learning Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) (Google)
* [Machine Learning Glossary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/resources/glossary) (Microsoft)

Read up about the term until you feel like you understand what it is. If the glossaries are not helpful (which is possible), consider asking ChatGPT to "Explain [*term*] in just a few of sentences, to a layperson.". *Now,* 

* In the Discord channel `#2-1-terminology`, **write** a single sentence report: "I learned the meaning of [*term*]." You can offer more information if you like, but it's purely optional.
