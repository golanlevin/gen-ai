## 1.1. Administrative Tasks

*(30 minutes • 10% • Due Thursday 1/16)*

* **Read** our [Syllabus]() carefully.
* **Join** our course Discord using [this invite](https://discord.gg/rx73UhZQ)
* It's not strictly *required*, but you are strongly advised to **purchase** an external hard drive, such as one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GTYFC37/?th=1), so that you can manage your assets.
* **Complete** this [Welcome Questionnaire](). My plan is to use this Questionnaire to help design this course, and tune it to your skills and interests. Thus, note that this Questionnaire asks some fairly involved questions, such as "What is an Assignment you would like to have in this class?", that I ask you to complete in good faith.
* Introduce yourself! In the Discord channel `1-1-introductions`, **write** a couple of sentences about who you are and why you're interested in this course. Optionally, feel free to **embed** an image or **include** a link to some of your work.

## 1.2. Report: An AI Art You Like

*(15 minutes • 10% • Due Thursday 1/16).*

* (Note: this exercise does not require any research. I'd like you to share what's already on your mind, rather than ask you to discover something new. The purpose is for us to learn about each others' tastes and interests.)
* **Identify** an artwork (or other creative project) that you admire, which uses (or was created with) machine learning or AI. I'm especially interested in projects made by individuals or small teams, as opposed to commercial projects by big companies.
* In the Discord channel `1-2-i-like-this`, **write** a few sentences about this project. **Describe** what it is, and **explain** what you appreciate about it and why.
* **Include** an image of the project, and **include** a URL link to some documentation. 
* Remember to **include** the creator's name and the title of the project.
* Be prepared for the possibility of giving a (very brief!) presentation about this project in class.

## 1.3. Looking Outwards: Algorithms, Models, Tools

*(15 minutes • 10% • Due Thursday 1/16).* Researchers are constantly publishing new algorithms and experimental demos on sites like [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/). Further out from the lab, bloggers like [EHuanglu](https://x.com/EHuanglu) (*"wild!"*), and various popular press sites like [Aixploria](https://www.aixploria.com/en/ultimate-list-ai/), [aitoolsdirectory](https://aitoolsdirectory.com/), [insidr.ai](https://www.insidr.ai/ai-tools/), *etcetera*, publish buzzy lists about new commercial software, such as "[The Best AI Tools for 2025](https://www.synthesia.io/post/ai-tools)". In this exercise, I ask you to do the following: 

* **Browse** some of the above links for 15 minutes. Be sure to view both academic and industry sources. 
* **Identify** a tool, demo, algorithm, model, or other technical resource that seems interesting to you. 
* In the Discord channel `#1-3-tools`, **write** a couple of sentences about the tool: what it *is*, what it *does*, and (especially) why it *interests you*. What might you imagine doing with it? (For example, you might say something like "I'm interested in cloning my voice with ElevenLabs so that I can make generative podcasts.") 
* In your response, **include** a link to the tool.

Keep in mind that (without making any promises) it *may* be possible to actually use that tool this semester! It depends on our skills, technological resources, and funding — but we do have some funds we can use to obtain tools outside the main list that we're using.

## 1.4. Viewing - Response 

*(30 minutes • 10% • Due Thursday 1/16).*

* [Alan Warburton](https://alanwarburton.co.uk/) is a media theorist and expert CGI animator. **Watch** [*The Wizard of AI*](https://vimeo.com/884929644), his 20-minute video essay about generative AI. (In this essay, Warburton uses tools like Runway and MidJourney to discuss and critique the legal, aesthetic and ethical problems they engender.) (Note: if time permits, we may watch this at the end of class session on 1/14.)
* In the Discord channel `1-4-viewing`, **write** a couple of sentences about something that stuck with you from Warburton's video essay.

## 1.5. Wrong Things

*(2 hours • 10% • Due Tuesday 1/21)*

Let's talk about *failure*. **Consider** this quote from Brian Eno, which is often cited in discussions about creativity and technology:

> *"Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of video, the crap sound of 8-bit—all these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided."*

Eno's premise is that the imperfections or "glitches" of a medium, which may initially be seen as flaws, often become celebrated characteristics that define its aesthetic and cultural significance. In our present case, however — beyond nostalgia — we can see that the way AI fails may be exactly what is, frankly, *interesting* about it. One of [these videos of Will Smith eating spaghetti](https://x.com/EHuanglu/status/1875907833084223647) is memorable, and the other is... not. We see the world in new ways, when we see how a machine has failed to know it as we do. 

*Now:*

* **Watch** this 90-second video of [AI Diving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnyJ-BidzIg).
* **Read** this article, [Is A.I. the Greatest Technology Ever for Making Dumb Jokes?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/10/style/ai-memes-jokes.html?unlocked_article_code=1.pE4.E_sg.OO7Y24WHv0NB&smid=url-share) (NYTimes, 2023; 6-minute read)
* **Read** through [the MidJourney documentation](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs). Spend at least 15 minutes doing this, the effort will give significant returns.
* **Experiment** with MidJourney to **identify** something that the AI has a difficult time representing. (Presumably this is a moving target.) Explore [using the older versions of the MidJourney models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/model-versions), which you can access with the `--version` command. **Generate** at least 3 images that show the glitch you have discovered.  
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel `1-5-glitches`. In this post, **write** a sentence or two describing your discovery, and **embed** your three images.
