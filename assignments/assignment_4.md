# Assignment Set #4: Off-Road Experiments


For this unit, we will turn our classroom into a *Sharing Laboratory*. Each day, we will have collective work sessions in which you make and share your experiments. The pressure is off to make "good" work; rather, our goal here is to **tinker freely**. For these experiments, think: less Deep Meaningful Art, more [Dumb Jokes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/10/style/ai-memes-jokes.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare).

This set of assignments has the following components:

* 4.1. [Specify Tools in our Spreadsheet](#4-1-specify-tools-in-our-spreadsheet) — *Due 3/20; 30 minutes*
* 4.2. [Readings: Slop; Other AIs](#4-2-readings-slop-other-ais) — *Due 3/25; 40 minutes*
* 4.3 & 4.4: **Experiments A & B** - *3-5 hours X2*

## 4.1. Specify Tools in our Spreadsheet 

*(Due Thursday 3/20. Estimated time: 30 minutes.)* 

* **Identify 3 tools** (whether open-source/free or commercial) which you'd like to use to conduct lightweight, low-stakes tinkering and experiments with. 
* We have a communal spreadsheet -- **populate** it with your list. (For example, personally, I want to experiment with Roboflow.) Then, I will pay the monies.
* Pay attention to the `key-information` channel in the Discord, where I will put login information for the various accounts!

*(Due Tuesday 3/25. Estimated time: 40 minutes.)* 

> *Eryk Salvaggio is a researcher and new media artist interested in the social and cultural impacts of artificial intelligence. His work explores the creative misuse of AI and the transformation of archives into datasets for AI training: a practice designed to expose ideologies of tech and to confront the gaps between datasets and the worlds they claim to represent. Eryk is the Emerging Technology Research Advisor for the Siegel Family Endowment, a philanthropic organization focused on responsible technology, and a researcher with AI Pedagogy Project with the metaLAB at Harvard University.*

For **Tuesday, March 25**, please:

* **Read** the following two recent articles by artist and media theorist Eryk Salvaggio:
  1. Eryk Salvaggio, [*Slop Infrastructures*, Parts 1 and 2](https://mail.cyberneticforests.com/slop-infrastructures-1-2/), 12/2024. *(12 minute read)*
  2. Eryk Salvaggio, [*Are Other AIs Possible?*](https://mail.cyberneticforests.com/sp/), 1/2025. *(15 minute read)*
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel, `#4-2-readings`.
* In your post, **write** a couple of sentences responding to the readings. For example, you might point out something that struck you as interesting, or that you disagreed with, etcetera.

## 4.3 & 4.4: Experiments A & B

*Approximately 3-5 hours of tinkering and experimentation, times 2. Posts should be planned for 3/25 or 3/27 and 4/1.*

* Please **document** at least two of your experiments and workflows. 
* **Write** posts in Discord channels `#4-Experiment-A` and `#4-Experiment-B`.  
* **Include** images and screenshots. Ideally, **document** your experiments a such a way that you can save your classmates some time if they decide to explore that tool later on. What did you do? How did you do it? What did you learn about this tool?
