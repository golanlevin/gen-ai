## 2.3. Toe-Dipping in ComfyUI

*30 minutes, due Thursday 1/30.*

In this simple exercise you will do some controlled experiments with the ComfyUI default patch. 

* At RunComfy.com, **load** the default patch ("Purple Galaxy Bottle"). Change the prompt according to your preferences.
* **Experiment** with different base models. At the bare minimum I encourage you to try the difference between SD 1.5 and SDXL, but try other models that are available in RunComfy as well.
* For these experiments, **modify** the `seed` value so that it is held constant, and then: 
  * **Experiment** with different samplers
  * **Experiment** with difrerent numbers of steps
  * **Experiment** with different denoising values
* In the Discord channel `2-3-ComfyTest`, **report** on your findings. A sentence or two is sufficient. **Provide** an image showing some of your findings.
