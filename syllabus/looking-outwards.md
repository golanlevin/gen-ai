# What is a “Looking Outwards Report”?

This semester, you will periodically be asked to “look outwards” — to browse various blogs and feeds or other resources in order to deepen your knowledge of the field, and familiarize yourself with the current state of the art. You will then be expected to report on your findings, as described below — hopefully, with a critical perspective. There is usually no restriction on the sources of information you may use for a “Looking Outwards” report.

A “Looking-Outwards” report is a brief post that reports on a project that interests you. Your job is to browse blogs and other sources, and then report on an artwork or other project *that you haven’t seen before*. Unless otherwise asked, reporting about a project of which you’re already aware defeats the point of the assignment, which is to deepen your familiarity with the fields of new media arts and creative technology — *and develop your own personal research practice*.

Hopefully the Looking Outwards reports will help you to find a collection of inspirational touchstones. Try to find things that you admire or even aspire to make yourself. For my courses, I usually try to encourage you to select projects that are made by individuals or small teams, rather than large companies, but that’s not a firm requirement.


### How to do a *Looking Outwards* report

In a posting,

* **Write** a paragraph (~100-150 words) about the project that interested you
* **Embed** an image and/or video documentation of the project
* **Include** a URL (web link) to the project, where a reader can learn more

In the paragraph you write, you should:

* **Explain** the project in a sentence or two (what *is* it? How does it operate? Etc.);
* **Describe** what inspires you about the project (i.e. what you find interesting, noteworthy, or admirable);
* **Critique** the project: describe how it might have been more effective; discuss some of the intriguing possibilities that it suggests, or opportunities that it missed; explain what you think the creator(s) got right, and how they got it right.
* **Research** the project’s chain of influences. Dig up the ‘deep background’, and compare the project with related work or prior art, if appropriate. What sources inspired the creator this project? What was “their” Looking Outwards?
Please be sure to label your blog post with our WordPress “category”, Part of the purpose of your Looking Outwards documentation is to increase the documentation, in the world, of noteworthy but vulnerable media artifacts. Therefore, when including video documentation of projects:


### Learning Outcomes of *Looking Outwards* Reports

After completing the sequence of Looking Outwards reports, you will be able to:

* Demonstrate familiarity with historic and/or contemporary new-media projects relevant to that student’s specific research interests;
* Demonstrate familiarity with new-media projects that exemplify cultural practices that use widely-used arts-engineering toolkits and/or with specific technologies.

### Grading of your *Looking Outwards* Reports

Please write *Looking Outwards* Reports in your own voice. I don't grade the quality of your work in these reports; each report can receive one of two marks:

* **0%.** You did not do the report.
* **100%.** You did the report.

### Where to research *Looking Outwards* subjects

Sometimes you will be pointed towards specific resources or archives to explore, sometimes compiling hundreds of annotated projects. It can be a little disappointing when two students choose the same project from the first page of results; please try to look past the first page of these archives, and seriously engage your curiosity. 

In addition, below is a list of some prominent online feeds that present current work in new media art. This list can be used as a starting point for preparing your regular *Looking Outwards* reports. Highly recommended:
