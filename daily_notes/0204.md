## Findings

#### Feedback

* **Feeding back** the results of the synthesis into the input: infinite zoom img2img with feedback: [**Video Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mITVOnG9Tlg).  Use the "[Image Sender / Image Receiver](https://www.runcomfy.com/comfyui-nodes/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack/ImageSender)" nodes in the the Impact node pack. 
  * *Note that the UI has changed slightly since this video tutorial was recorded. The Checkbox in his video is the same as checking the "Auto Queue" box now (and — you have to also check the "extra options checkbox" to display it!).*
