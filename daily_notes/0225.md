## UMAP/t-SNE Mosaic

*Assignment 3.5: Produce a rectified embedding grid visualization.*

By the end of class on Tuesday 2/25, you *should* be able to **make a mosaic** that presents an image dataset in an organized way using UMAP/t-SNE. However, in case you hit any snags, be sure to finish this before class on Thursday 2/27. Your two options for doing this work are: 

* [ImageRearranger Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/golanlevin/ImageRearranger/blob/master/ImageRearranger.ipynb)
* [ImageRearranger Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rgxYnSziGuToW0oLbmzSwq470e6nVXHC?usp=sharing)
