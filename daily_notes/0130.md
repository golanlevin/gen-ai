## Workflows from Class

*The images below are ComfyUI workflow-PNGs, which have Comfy node networks embedded in their image metadata. You can upload these PNGs directly into RunComfy to recover the networks.* 

1. Cat Describer Workflow
2. Radish Baby (Masked Latent) Workflow
3. Prompted Inpainting Workflow

---

### 1. Cat Describer Workflow

* Load a 512x512 [**image of a cat**](workflows/cat.jpg) (available here)
* Use the *Florence2Run* node to automatically caption it
* Use the caption as the CLIP text prompt for Stable Diffusion
* *Voilà*, a "conceptual copy" of the original cat image

### 2. Radish Baby (Masked Latent) Workflow

* Load a 512x512 [**gradient image**](workflows/gradient.jpg) (available here)
* Convert the gradient into a Comfy mask object
* Also, make an inverted copy of the gradient, and make a mask from that too
* Build a pair of masked conditioners with the pair of complementary masks. 
* Give different prompts ("muscular radish", "baby driving") to each of the masked conditioners. 
* Combine the masked conditioners and proceed with Stable Diffusion
* *Voilà*, an image which conceptually crossfades from a "muscular radish" to a "baby driving".

### 3. Prompted Inpainting Workflow

* Load an image of a [**man looking confused**](workflows/pexels-photo-6867962.jpg) (available here)
* Use the mask painter tool to create a mask of his shirt
* Use the mask to set up the *Set Latent Noise Mask* node, which will regulate which pixels will undergo Stable Diffusion, and which pixels won't. 
* Proceed with Stable Diffusion. Now, only his shirt will be affected by the Stable Diffusion prompt ("football jersey"). 
* *Voilà*, his shirt is inpainted as a football jersey.
