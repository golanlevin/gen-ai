Premade datasets are biased. 
All datasets are made by humans
• most training datasets are designed to be very broad, often avoid minority considerations
(celebrities, creative commons)
• almost all photograph-based
• often for business purposes 
  (facial recognition, self-driving cars)
• often limited resolutions

Pre-trained models only cover a small set of use cases.
Many datasets are also just really bad!

Dataset Normalization

1. Scrape images
2. Toss out images that are too small
3. Toss out dupes
4. Hand Curate 
5. Optional: resize, crop, augment
6. Human review

## Dataset Ethics

Adapted from notes by Derrick Schultz, and from [*Making AI Art Responsibly: A Field Guide*](https://partnershiponai.org/) by Emily Saltz, Lia Coleman, Claire Leibowicz.

#### WAYS TO MAKE DATASETS

1. **Make your own!** Use your own illustrations, photography, text, or video. 
  * Safest approach, 
  * It’s all yours! :)
  * Labor-intensive
2. **Scrape existing media.**
  * Least-risky: Use media that is in the public domain (NASA, Biodiversity Heritage Library)
  * Riskier: Scraping existing media = using someone else’s data. ([Fursona controversy](https://gizmodo.com/the-internet-furry-drama-raising-big-questions-about-ar-1843412922) -  thisfursonadoesnotexist ignited a fandom firestorm when it was trained on more than 55,000 images pulled (without permission) from a furry art forum)
  * [Everest Pipkin (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYNKs8vfocc): “To work with generative systems is to be a curator...to curate a corpus is to value the contributions inside of it...they are still artworks individually, and the people who make them are still artists. [...] Curating your own corpora is to be able to deal with the original creators of your corpora as humans and as collaborators, not as datapoints.”
  * Give credit! [Pipkin](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018/issues/110)
3. **Use existing ready-made datasets**.
  * Think about: *Who made this dataset? Why? Was the data ethically sourced?*
  * Example: MegaFace Dataset, a Public FaceRec dataset of 4.7M faces, scraped by UW from Flickr users' photo albums without permission, and then Used by Amazon, Google, Tencent, etc. for Facial Recognition

If your dataset has people in it, ask yourself:

* How would I feel if my picture- or my friends and family’s pictures- were in this dataset?
* How can I ask for consent?

#### SUMMARY OF BEST PRACTICES

* Least risky: Use your own illustrations, photography, text, or video.
* If you are scraping work, prioritize work that is in the public domain, or directly ask for permission from those whose identity and/or work is represented in the dataset. 
* Credit the work of others whenever possible. If you are posting online, tag people and thank them!

## Art 

**NOTE**: Be prepared for the possibility that your *dataset itself*, as a never-before-seen object, or the *act of collecting* your dataset, as a kind of performance, *might be more interesting* than what you create with an AI trained on it.
